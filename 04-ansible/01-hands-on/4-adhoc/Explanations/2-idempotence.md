# Idempotence

- Before moving further you should know what is idempotence and how ansible use idempotence

- Idempotence is the concept which is borrowed from Mathematics

- Ansible uses this concept very much

- An idempotence refers one operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial apply

- Hence all modules of Ansible are idempotent.
